Follow these steps to create a new release:

## 1. Review unreleased changes

Read `CHANGELOG.md` and show the user all items under `[Unreleased]`. Ask the user to confirm these are the changes they want to include in the release. If the `[Unreleased]` section is empty, stop and inform the user there is nothing to release.

## 2. Suggest version number

Look at the previous version in `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. `[2.0]`) and analyze the unreleased changes to recommend a version bump:

- **Major** (e.g. `2.0` → `3.0`) — breaking changes, architectural rewrites, or incompatible API changes
- **Minor** (e.g. `2.0` → `2.1`) — new features, enhancements, or non-breaking additions
- **Patch** (e.g. `2.1` → `2.1.1`) — bug fixes only, no new features

Explain the reasoning and let the user confirm or override the suggested version.

## 3. Update CHANGELOG.md

- Rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [<version>] - <today's date>` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it
- Preserve all existing content below

## 4. Update package.json versions

Set the `version` field to the new version in:
- `issuer/package.json`
- `verification/package.json`

## 5. Run tests

Run `npm test` from the repo root to ensure everything passes before releasing. If tests fail, stop and inform the user.

## 6. Build assets

Run `npm run build` in both `issuer/` and `verification/` directories. Then create zip archives:
- `zip -r issuer-v<version>.zip issuer/dist`
- `zip -r verification-v<version>.zip verification/dist`

## 7. Stage, commit, and push

Stage the modified files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `issuer/package.json`, `verification/package.json`) by name. Ask the user which alias to use:

- **`git cai`** — AI-attributed commit (sets author to "AI Generated (hhkaos)" and prefixes the message with "AI: ")
- **`git ch`** — Regular commit with the user's default git identity

Commit with message: `release: v<version>`

Then push with `git push`.

## 8. Create git tag

Run `git tag v<version>` and `git push --tags`.

## 9. Create GitHub Release

Use `gh release create` to create the release on GitHub:

```
gh release create v<version> \
  --title "v<version>" \
  --notes "<changelog entries for this version>" \
  issuer-v<version>.zip \
  verification-v<version>.zip
```

The `--notes` should contain the full changelog entries for this version (the Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed sections) formatted in markdown.

## 10. Clean up

Remove the temporary zip files:
- `rm issuer-v<version>.zip verification-v<version>.zip`

Confirm the release is live by showing the GitHub Release URL.
