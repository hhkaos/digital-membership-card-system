# Verifier User Manual

## Who this guide is for

This guide is for AMPA-friendly businesses that need to verify the membership cards of AMPA members.

## What Verifier does

When scanning a QR code, the verifier checks:

- The validity date of the QR code
- The expiry date
- That the code was generated by AMPA Novaschool Almería
- Whether the person is still an AMPA member or has been removed for any reason

## Understanding the states

### Valid membership

- Green state with the member's name
- Shows the validity date
- Confirms the person is still an AMPA member

### Revoked membership

- The person is no longer part of the AMPA
- The card/member should not be accepted
- A contact link is provided for support
