# Roadmap

This project is actively developed using a **vibe-coding** approach — new features are added iteratively with AI assistance, and the codebase evolves rapidly.

## How we plan and track progress

We use two key documents to define and track the project's direction:

### [SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) — Technical Specification

The SPEC defines **what** we're building: requirements, architecture, security model, token format, and deployment strategy. It's the source of truth for how the system should work. If you want to understand the project's design decisions, start here.

### [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) — Roadmap & Progress Tracker

The TODO tracks **where we are**: a phase-by-phase implementation checklist covering everything from the MVP through V2 features. Each phase has specific tasks, tests, and manual verification steps.

## Current status

**MVP (V1)**: Complete — Phases 1-5 shipped (verification app, issuer app, CSV batch processing, documentation, testing & CI/CD).

**V2**: In progress — Adding advanced features:

| Phase | Feature | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 6 | Revocation system | In progress |
| 7 | Internationalization (i18n) | Complete |
| 8 | Wallet-style cards | Planned |
| 9 | PWA features (offline issuer) | Planned |
| 10 | Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) | Planned |
| 11 | GitHub Pages deployment | Planned |
| 12 | Analytics (optional) | Planned |

## Want a new feature?

1. **Check the [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md)** — it might already be planned
2. **Open a [feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md)** — describe what you'd like and why
3. **Sponsor development** — if you'd like me to prioritize a specific feature, reach out at [rauljimenez.info](https://rauljimenez.info) to discuss
